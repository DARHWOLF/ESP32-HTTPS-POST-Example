# ESP32-HTTPS-POST-Example
This project connects an ESP32 to a WiFi network and performs a secure HTTPS POST request to "httpbin.org". The sketch uses the WiFiClientSecure library to handle the HTTPS connection and includes the server's CA certificate for secure communication. The data sent in the POST request includes the ESP32 chip ID and a sender's name.
